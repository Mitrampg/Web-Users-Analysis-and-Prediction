# Web-Users-Analysis-and-Prediction

This project uses deep learning techniques to analyze the behavior of website users and predict their likelihood of staying or stopping using the site (churn). 
Through comprehensive data analysis and the application of deep learning models, this project aims to provide insights that can help in user retention strategies.

## Deployment Model

Here is a deployed model application where you can predict website user churn by inputting user characteristics: https://bit.ly/web_users_predict

## Objective

The main goal of this project is to identify users with a high probability of churn, understand their characteristics and behavior, and develop a model that can accurately predict user retention or churn. This is important for improving marketing strategies and customer retention.

## Workflow

The workflow process includes:

Import and install required libraries.

Load and review data to get an overview.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain an in-depth understanding of the data.

Apply feature engineering techniques to optimize data for modeling.

Defining and training models using TensorFlow, with exploration of Sequential and Functional models.

Evaluate the model to assess its effectiveness in predicting churn.

Save the trained model for inference on new data.

## Conclusion

This project succeeded in developing a deep learning model that is able to predict website user churn with satisfactory accuracy. 
Although the model shows good performance, there is still room for improvement, especially in terms of feature handling and model tuning. These results provide a strong basis for further development in an effort to increase user retention on digital platforms.
